Task format:
* TODO, incomplete
+ TODO, complete
- TODO, blocked

Anything else is a comment and ignored.
Each TODO must be a single line

Commands:
* devlog-edit: open latest devlog in $EDITOR, creating a new one if it doesn't exist.
* devlog-rollover: copy incomplete tasks from the previous devlog to a new devlog.
* devlog-tail: show latest devlogs in descending order by time
* devlog-status: show completed tasks from previous devlog, incomplete tasks from current devlog

Files are sequential, named by datetime of creation with millisecond precision.
Devlog directory is in $DEVLOG_DIR, defaults to $HOME/devlogs
Acquire a lock file to ensure that the tool doesn't race to create the new file.

Hooks (for stuff like JIRA/Github integration, parsing additional metadata from files, etc):
* post-create PATH_TO_NEW_DEVLOG
* pre-edit PATH_TO_DEVLOG
* post-edit PATH_TO_DEVLOG
* pre-rollover PATH_TO_OLD_DEVLOG
* post-rollover PATH_TO_OLD_DEVLOG PATH_TO_NEW_DEVLOG

Other stuff, nice to haves
* package managers (brew, apt-get, dnf, pacman)
* homepage, tutorials
* syntax highlighting for the format in vim
